 The idea is to mirror the functionality of "Lab Journal Chem.pdf" which currently uses rich buttons for internal hyperlinking.

 In the "./templates/" folder, this pdf is broken into its fundamental parts

 This includes 1) a background template as required by the original script, 2) a cover page, 3) two constants pages, 4) TOC pages for sections 1-5,

 5) 3 pages for Misc Notes, 6) Sections 1-5 each with 40 pages per section

 All pages should have hyperlinks on the book tabs redirecting to one of the first 9 pages (see "Lab Journal Chem.pdf")

 All TOCs should link to the correct page under the "DESC" heading

 All section pages have an arrow which links back to that sections respective 
 
 Original script is contained in "backup" files and in "example assets" folder.
